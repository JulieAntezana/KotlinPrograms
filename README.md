# KotlinPrograms

# Overview
This repository contains small programs and a tutorial that I wrote while learning the Kotlin language.
I learned Kotlin by completing a course on sololearn.com. For this course, I wrote four code projects. 
In addition, I worked on a game tutorial:
* Water Consumption - designed to demonstrate mastery of variables, operators, comments, and input in Kotlin
* Parking Fee - designed to demonstrate mastery of conditional statements.
* Shipping Calculator - designed to demonstrate mastery of programming with functions.
* Music Player -  designed to demonstrate mastery of programming with classes.
* Sudoku Game Tutorial - The code here is not my own. I followed a tutorial to help engage my learning of the Kotlin programming language. The tutorial, called "Building a Sudoku Game with Kotlin" was written by Rafaela Acevedo and can be found at this url:

The tutorial has three parts. The files here in the repository are a result of my working through parts one and two. 
For part one, I learned how to create a project in intellij Idea.  The tutorial provides three files.
* GameFrame.kt - contains all the code needed to create the user interface for the game. All code is already provided.
* Main.kt - the main function is the entry point in the application.
* SudokuGame.kt - contains the skeleton for game logic on which I was able to build the game as I went step by 
step through the tutorial.
In part two we add the ability to read an array file that is then mapped to the game board.
We also add the ability to validate the user input.

My purpose for writing this software is to further my knowledge of the Kotlin programming language.

I have created a video to demonstrate my Kotlin learning journey. I show the work I did on sololearn.com followed by a walkthrough of the Sudoku Game code.

# Development Environment
The tools used to develop the Sudoku Game are:
* IntelliJ IDEA - an application designed to maximize developer productivity
* Java SDK - a development environment for building applications written in Java or Kotlin.
* Kotlin - this is a modern and powerful cross-platform programming language, designed to interoperate with Java.

# Future Work
Some things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:
* Work through part three of the tutorial. I did attempt this, but there were some instructions that generated errors.
* Create a library of Sudoku Game solutions 
* Add the ability to set different levels of difficulty.
* Create a Sudoku Gameboard generator.
